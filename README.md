This is the core of [Analytics.js][], the open-source library that powers data collection at [Segment](https://segment.com).

To build this into a full, usable library, see the [Analytics.js](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js) repository.

## Using Types

We've recently introduced Typescript support and types to Analytics.js Core. While the exposed types still need some work
(pull requests are welcome!), they're ready to be used.

### Importing as an npm module

If you use analytics.js-core as an npm module, you can leverage its types out of the box:
